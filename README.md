image-comparator
================

Compare two images using a simple algorithm.

Algorithm comes from here (link broken at this time): http://www.lac.inpe.br/JIPCookbook/6050-howto-compareimages.jsp

The purpose of this project is simply to try out the algorithm before using it in a other projects.  Thus, the code sucks.

exit(aNumber)
-------------
You may wonder where those number come from.  Well I was simply writing the number of the line of code in there to know print it on exit, although the printStackTrace of exception does just that.
